The client in question is The Gaming Room, who requested a web application software developed based after their mobile app, Draw It or Lose It. In developing the document for said software, I felt I did particularly well in the initial document in which I described the inital design constraints and overview. It was definitely helpful to use the design document to develop code because it allowed for a clear idea of what the end product is intended to be. When reviewing the document, I could definitely do better in researching and describing in detail the different elements of the many operating systems described in the chart. It is essential to understand the user's needs when developing software, as it will greatly help in testing the software with what the user needs to see in mind, as I did with the Draw It or Lose It software. Understanding this is key for developing a great end product. When designing the product, it was essential that I build upon the client's inital requests and needs. By starting with analyzing how to create a software aligned with the client;s needs as well as the users,  the design process went all the more smoothly. It will be essential to do so in the future with projects.
